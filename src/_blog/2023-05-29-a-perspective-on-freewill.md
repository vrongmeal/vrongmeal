title: A perspective on freewill
description: |
  I recently read "Story of your life" by Ted Chiang. In many ways, it was an
  eye-opening journey. Here are a few thoughts that I gathered from this
  amazing short story.

---

‚ÄúStory of your life‚Äù is a story about a mother reminiscing the memories of her
daughter who dies during rock climbing. What‚Äôs weird is that the events she
describes haven‚Äôt taken place yet. Her daughter isn‚Äôt even born. She knows the
future.

But how does she know the future? It all starts when a bunch of alien spaceships
visit earth. It‚Äôs unclear why they _arrived_. Are they here for an invasion?
Maybe they are just tourists visiting earth. Dr. Louise Banks is a professional
linguist who‚Äôs hired to interact with the aliens and figure out why they are
here. She, along with a fellow physicist Gary, tries to unfold the mystery by
learning aliens‚Äô language. During the process of learning this foreign language,
she discovers the difference between how humans think compared to this species
of aliens‚Ä¶

## Freewill

There‚Äôs been a lot of discussion about freewill in the scientific community.
It‚Äôs logical that there might not be any such thing, that we‚Äôre bound by laws
of physics to act in a way that we do. What I love about ‚ÄúStory of your life‚Äù
is that the author, Ted Chiang, doesn‚Äôt discuss freewill like we understand. He
states that having or not having freewill are simply different perspectives.

The story talks a lot about **Fermat‚Äôs Principle.** This is one of the things
that made it easier for Louise to understand aliens‚Äô language. It states that
a ray of light travels from one point to the another in order to minimise the
time taken to travel. This basically explains why light travels in a straight
line when in the same medium and bends when there is a change in medium.
What‚Äôs interesting is I used to think of bending of light as a property of
medium of travel. Both these approaches are correct, they are simply different
perspectives.

> A ray of light travels in a straight line from point A to point O and then
bends in order to travel in a straight line from point O to point B. Point A and
point B lie in different media.

This situation can be visualised in two different ways:

1. Light starts travelling from point A, hits point O and bends reaching the
   point B during its journey. This is a very intuitive interpretation of the
   scenario.

2. Light will travel from point A to point B. In order to do so, it travels
   from point A to point O and later point O to point B because this is the fastest
   path. This is in fact what the Fermat‚Äôs principle describes.

We as humans find it hard to digest the second perspective. How do we know
that light ‚Äúwill‚Äù travel from point A to point B? Light reaching point B is
in the future. Everything has a ‚Äúcause‚Äù. X causes Y, Y causes Z and so on. No
matter how we reason with it, this perspective describes not just similar, but
the exact same situation. I like to think that the first perspective describes
behaviour whereas the second one describes the path.

Let‚Äôs take another example. I love programming which inspired me to dive deep
into the world of software engineering. I started making software that I thought
were cool which led me to a job. The job required me to work on databases and it
caught my interest. I learned more about databases which eventually landed me a
job at my current company.

What if I represent the situation as ‚Äì to land a job at my current company, I
need to learn about databases and gain some experience in it. This would require
me to work on some other database which would be open to hiring a fresher. In
order to crack the interviews, I need to code some software, which means I need
to learn programming.

Both the interpretations refer to the exact same situation. There‚Äôs a lot that
the second interpretation doesn‚Äôt explain. For example, it doesn‚Äôt explain my
love for programming. But that‚Äôs what the difference in perspective is. The
‚Äúbehaviour‚Äù interpretation looks for a cause. The ‚Äúpath‚Äù interpretation looks
for an objective. The cause ‚Äúlove of programming‚Äù pushed me into the world
of software whereas, to achieve my objective I started programming which I
also loved. Our belief that we have a freewill doesn‚Äôt go well with the path
interpretation. This is simply because we cannot see the future. We don‚Äôt know
what‚Äôs going to happen in the future. We believe that things might change on
the way that we behave. Even if we knew the future, we might be able to change
things.

The story challenges exactly this thought. It‚Äôs not about knowing the future.
It focuses on the fact that in order to achieve an objective, there is a path
that needs to be followed. The path of light is defined only when it knows it
needs to reach a certain point. If you change the destination, the path will
change. So, whether or not we have freewill, you can derive the path to reach
a certain destination. This doesn‚Äôt mean that we don‚Äôt have a freewill, or even
that we do. It is simply another perspective on how we see things happening in
this world.

## The effect of language

The movie ‚ÄúArrival‚Äù is based on this story. It does a pretty good job of
presenting how the language we think in changes our perspective to see things.
The language written by the aliens, _Heptapod B_, is one such language. It‚Äôs
written in a way that you can only write it if you already know everything
that‚Äôs supposed to be written. Imagine you‚Äôre writing a sentence. We start with
the first alphabet of the sentence, join the others to form a word, add a space
to separate the word with the next word and keep repeating until we reach the
end of sentence and finally add a full-stop. What if you already knew the amount
of space that‚Äôs going to be taken by the sentence, each word in that sentence.
You could put the full stop immediately before writing the complete sentence.
You could write any word at the exact position it was supposed to be. It‚Äôs
not impossible for us to write this way. Unfortunately, the languages we write
themselves stem from the ‚Äúbehaviour‚Äù perspective. We think sequentially, so we
write sequentially. Character after character, word after word. This recursively
assures our thought process to work in a sequential manner. We write the full
stop because the sentence is ended. Maybe we end the sentence because there is a
full stop.

## Epilogue

This movie and story has given me so much to think. I highly recommend everyone
to try both. Having a different perspective gives you an appreciation for
new things, opens up your mind to more beautiful experiences in life. I feel
inspired to learn a new language. It‚Äôs exciting to see how this new language
transforms the way I think. You could also say my objective is to gain a new
perspective and the way I can gain it is by learning a new language üòõ
