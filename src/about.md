## Humble Beginnings

I grew up in a small town in Punjab and did my schooling from Chaman Vatika
School in Ambala. I learned about HTML/CSS while playing with what was then
"Macromedia Dreamweaver". Ever since I have been trying to learn and explore
various technologies.

## College

Currently I am a senior at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (batch '21).
There I am a developer at [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), an awesome group of
students constantly striving to innovate and foster technical activities at
IIT Roorkee. I am also a web-developer at [WatchOut!](http://watchout.iitr.ac.in/),
the student media body of our college.

## Work

I was a student developer in GSoC 2019 with the Zulip Open Source Project.
I also did an internship with Goldman Sachs in the summer of 2020.

I like to contribute to open source in general. I feel it's one of the best
ways to learn something new. Apart from Zulip, I've made my contributions to
Caddy, Cockroach DB and Falco.

I mostly code in Go, some JavaScript and Python. I like to try out new
languages. It's kind of my hobby. Apart from the aforementioned languages,
I know a little bit of Rust, C++ too.

## Personal Interests

I follow Football (soccer) and I love Cricket (#BleedBlue). I also started
learning to cook. My favourite TV shows are Modern Family, Game of Thrones
(till 6th Season), Friends and Gravity Falls. I mostly watch sitcoms, not
really a movie guy, though I like watching rom-coms.
